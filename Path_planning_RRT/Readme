Path_planning

A path planning algorithm based on RRT implemented using ROS.

ROS kinetic

The algorithm find an optimized path for a one obstacle environment. The visualtization is done in RVIZ and the code is written in C++. 

The package has two executables: 
ros_node 
env_node 

RVIZ parameters: 
Frame_id = "/path_planner" 
marker_topic = "path_planner_rrt" 
Instructions: 


How to run?
$roscore 
Open new terminal and go to the the root of your catkin workspace and in the catkin_ws/src
$catkin_make 
$source ./devel/setup.bash 
$rosrun path_planning env_node 
open new terminal 
$rosrun rviz rviz 
In the RVIZ window, change: 
fixed frame under global option to "/path_planner" 
add a marker and change marker topic to "path_planner_rrt" 
Open new terminal 
$rosrun path_planning rrt_node 
The environment and the path will be visualized in RVIZ.
